//! Price sources for the scheduler.
//!
//! Everything here delegates to the shared `oracle-example-sources` crate, which is the same code
//! the TEE worker runs. That matters more than it looks: the scheduler's only job is to notice
//! when its own view of a price disagrees with the worker's, so any difference in *how* the two
//! sides fetch shows up as a permanent disagreement and a refresh trigger that never stops
//! firing. This file used to carry a second copy of every fetcher, and it had already drifted —
//! its Pyth staleness bound was a hardcoded 120 rather than `parsers::PYTH_MAX_AGE_SECS`, and
//! it subtracted timestamps without saturating.
//!
//! Exchange configs come from public storage (synced from the contract via DAO).
