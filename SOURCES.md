# Available Price Sources

This document lists the price sources the oracle actually supports, and the exact
configuration format used to attach them to an asset.

> Source dispatch lives in [`sources/src/sources.rs`](sources/src/sources.rs)
> (`fetch_all_sources` for a single asset, `fetch_all_sources_batch` for a whole set —
> one request per source instead of one per asset); the config type is `ExchangeConfig` in
> [`sources/src/lib.rs`](sources/src/lib.rs). Adding a key that no source reads is
> silently ignored (unknown fields are dropped on parse), so keep this list in sync
> with the code.

## Per-asset configuration format

An asset's sources are configured as a single JSON object (an `ExchangeConfig`),
**not** a list of `{name, id}` entries. Each supported exchange is an optional field;
a source is queried only if its field is present. This is exactly the shape stored in
[`tokens.json`](tokens.json) and pushed on-chain via the `SetAssetExchangeConfig`
governance action.

```json
{
  "decimals": 24,
  "coingecko": "near",
  "binance": "NEARUSDT",
  "binance_us": "NEARUSD",
  "huobi": "nearusdt",
  "cryptocom": "NEAR_USDT",
  "kucoin": "NEAR-USDT",
  "gate": "near_usdt",
  "pyth": "0xc415de8d2eba7db216527dff4b60e8f3a5311c740dadb233e13e12547e226750",
  "chainlink": "0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419",
  "kraken": "NEARUSD",
  "coinbase": "NEAR-USD",
  "bitstamp": "NEAR/USD",
  "okx": "NEAR-USDT",
  "bitget": "NEARUSDT",
  "mexc": "NEARUSDT",
  "stablecoin": false
}
```

`decimals` and `stablecoin` are metadata (used by the UI / aggregation), not sources.

## Supported sources

| Field | Source | ID format | Example |
|-------|--------|-----------|---------|
| `coingecko` | CoinGecko API | CoinGecko coin id | `"near"`, `"bitcoin"`, `"tether"` |
| `binance` | Binance global | trading symbol | `"NEARUSDT"` |
| `binance_us` | Binance US | trading symbol | `"NEARUSD"` |
| `binance_alpha` | Binance Alpha (wallet token list) | BSC contract address | `"0x…"` |
| `pyth` | Pyth Network (Hermes) | price feed id (`0x` optional) | `"0xc415…6750"` |
| `chainlink` | Chainlink (Ethereum aggregator) | aggregator contract address | `"0x5f4eC3…8419"` |
| `huobi` | Huobi / HTX | lowercase symbol | `"nearusdt"` |
| `kucoin` | KuCoin | dash symbol | `"NEAR-USDT"` |
| `gate` | Gate.io | lowercase underscore pair | `"near_usdt"` |
| `cryptocom` | Crypto.com | underscore instrument | `"NEAR_USDT"` |
| `kraken` | Kraken | **canonical** pair name | `"NEARUSD"`, `"XXBTZUSD"` |
| `coinbase` | Coinbase Exchange | product id (fiat USD) | `"NEAR-USD"` |
| `bitstamp` | Bitstamp | slashed pair (fiat USD) | `"NEAR/USD"` |
| `okx` | OKX | dash instrument id | `"NEAR-USDT"` |
| `bitget` | Bitget | plain symbol | `"NEARUSDT"` |
| `mexc` | MEXC | plain symbol (USDT only) | `"NEARUSDT"` |

Quote currency matters: `kraken`, `coinbase` and `bitstamp` quote **real fiat USD**, so they
price a stablecoin independently of USDT. `okx`, `bitget` and `mexc` are USDT-quoted (except
`okx`'s `USDT-USD`), so their reading carries whatever USDT is worth at the time.

Notes:
- **CoinGecko** accepts an optional API key via the `API_KEY` secret (sent as
  `x_cg_pro_api_key`); all other exchanges are keyless.
- **Chainlink** reads Ethereum RPC with automatic multi-RPC failover; if every RPC fails,
  Chainlink is skipped for that run and an alert is sent. A single asset is read with
  `latestAnswer()`; a set of assets is read in one `eth_call` through Multicall3
  (`aggregate3` with `allowFailure = true`, `latestRoundData()` per feed), so a delisted
  feed is reported on its own instead of taking the other feeds down with it.
- **Binance** requests go to `data-api.binance.vision`, which serves the same public
  market-data API as `api.binance.com` — the latter answers HTTP 451 from geo-blocked
  regions, including our worker egress.
- **Kraken** uses legacy asset codes, so the pair is often not what you would guess:
  `XXBTZUSD`, `XETHZUSD`, `XXRPZUSD`, `XDGUSD` (Dogecoin), `XXLMZUSD`, `XLTCZUSD`,
  `XZECZUSD`, while newer listings are plain (`NEARUSD`, `SOLUSD`, `USDCUSD`, `WBTCUSD`).
  Store the **canonical** name: Kraken answers under it whatever alias you request, and the
  batch parser only falls back to alias matching when the canonical name does not match.
  Kraken also drops the *entire* batch (HTTP 200, `error: ["EQuery:Unknown asset pair"]`)
  when one pair is unknown, so a bad entry triggers a per-pair retry rather than losing
  Kraken for every asset.
- **Coinbase** has no batch form of `/ticker`, so a set of assets is read from
  `/products/stats`. That endpoint is cached ~5s against the ticker's ~1s and therefore
  trails it slightly (measured: 3.68 bps median divergence, 8.60 bps max) — well inside the
  freshness SLA. `/products` also lists delisted markets whose `/ticker` answers HTTP 400;
  those are absent from `/products/stats`, and a missing or zero stat is treated as a
  missing source, never as a price.
- **Bitget** carries its price in `lastPr`, not `last`.
- **MEXC**'s `ticker/price` endpoint quotes USDT pairs only and reports no timestamp.
- **FRAX is deliberately configured without any exchange source.** After Frax's April-2025
  rebrand the ticker `FRAX` on exchanges is the *governance* token (~$0.27, verified live on
  MEXC), while the asset the oracle prices (`0x853d955a…`) is the *stablecoin* (~$0.99).
  Attaching a CEX `FRAX` symbol would feed a ~73%-wrong price into a lending oracle, so FRAX
  stays address-based (`chainlink` / `coingecko`) only.

## Source-side freshness

Only **Pyth** exposes an upstream data timestamp that the oracle checks: prices whose
`publish_time` is older than 120 seconds are rejected
([`sources/src/sources.rs`](sources/src/sources.rs), `fetch_pyth`). Every other
endpoint above is stamped with the fetch time and is only as fresh as the moment it was
read — including `bitstamp`, `okx` and `bitget`, whose batch endpoints *do* report an
upstream time that the parsers carry but the aggregator does not act on. See
[the platform freshness docs](https://app.outlayer.ai/docs/tee-attestation#data-freshness)
for how consumers should reason about age.

## Refresh tiers

Sources are not all refreshed together. Each stored price keeps the **per-source observation
time**, and a refresh merges into that record rather than replacing it, so venues can run at
different cadences:

| Tier | Venues | Assets | Interval |
|------|--------|--------|----------|
| fast | everything except the slow tier | `PRIORITY_ASSETS` | `UPDATE_INTERVAL_PRIORITY_SECS` |
| full | everything except the slow tier | all | `UPDATE_INTERVAL_SECS` |
| slow | `SLOW_SOURCES` (`pyth`, `chainlink`) | all that configure them | `SLOW_SOURCE_INTERVAL_SECS` |

The intervals are scheduler configuration and are deliberately not quoted here as numbers — they
live in one `.env` on one host, and a figure copied into documentation outlives the setting it
described. Read the effective values off the scheduler's startup log, or off the per-source
timestamps in any stored record.

The split exists because cost per refresh is wildly uneven: the exchange endpoints answer for
the whole asset set in one request, while Chainlink is an EVM `eth_call` through Multicall3 and
Pyth a separate API. Paying for those on every cycle is what made a fast cadence unaffordable.

Consumers pick their own window with `max_age_secs`, which filters **sources**: a request for 40
seconds is answered from the venues seen within 40 seconds — the slow tier does not participate —
and the returned `publish_time` is the oldest source that did. Widening the window lets the slow
tier back in and moves `publish_time` accordingly. A source that stops answering keeps its last
observation for 15 minutes and then drops out of the record entirely.

## Custom data sources

Arbitrary HTTP endpoints are **not** part of `ExchangeConfig`. They are fetched through
the `request_custom_data` / `custom_call` path using a `CustomSourceConfig`, which
supports GET/POST, request bodies, custom headers, and dot/array JSON-path extraction:

```json
{
  "custom": {
    "url": "https://api.example.com/price",
    "json_path": "data.price",
    "value_type": "number",
    "method": "GET",
    "headers": []
  }
}
```

- `value_type`: `"number"` (default), `"string"`, or `"boolean"`.
- `method`: `"GET"` (default) or `"POST"` (add a `body` object for POST).
- `json_path`: dot notation with array indexes, e.g. `"1245620.data.price_overview.final"`.
- Custom-source URLs are validated against local/private network access (SSRF guard).

See [CUSTOM_POST_BODY.md](CUSTOM_POST_BODY.md) for POST-body examples.
